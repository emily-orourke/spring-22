This piece focuses on movement and depth throughout each stage of the project. It started with photographs taken of the library which I found to be interesting.
Then I expiramented with a new pattern I discovered made of circles. I also discovered how the different techniques can create new textures and used this knowlege to better my final pieces. 
I took my new pattern along with my love for mind games, and optical illusions to create the final piece. I am fascinated by the way peoples eyes follow a piece where the artist wants, so I used that to my advantage. 
I decided to really push myself during this process and further my abstraction abilities.
